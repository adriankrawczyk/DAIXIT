**✨ DAIXIT ✨** is a 3D multiplayer web game built with React that uses AI to generate images for cards that you are playing to ensure that they are always fresh 🥶. Connect with up to 8 friends for an really fun gaming experience! Currently in active development, DAIXIT reimagines the beloved classic board game Dixit with a technological twist 🤖.

## 🎲 How To Play DAIXIT 🎲

DAIXIT puts your creativity and intuition to the test! Here's how it works:

1. 🎯 **The WordMaker's Turn**: One random player becomes the WordMaker and selects a card from their hand with a clue that describes it.

2. 🃏 **Card Selection**: All other players submit a card from their own hand that best matches the WordMaker's clue.

3. 🧩 **The Guessing Game**: Everyone votes on which card they believe belongs to the Wordmaker.

4. ⚡ **Scoring Twist**: Here's the clever catch - the Storyteller scores ZERO points if:
   - 😱 EVERYONE guesses correctly (too obvious!)
   - 😭 NO ONE guesses correctly (too obscure!)
